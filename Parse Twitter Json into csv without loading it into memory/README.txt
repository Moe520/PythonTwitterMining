This script allows you to parse a json file containing tweets into a csv. It iterates element by element and extracts data from each element to append to the csv of your choice. Because it works iteratively, it's not affected by the size of the json and it doesnt use a lot of RAM (uses about 0.2 gigs for json file of any size)
